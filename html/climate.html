    <h3> Ways Venice has already been affected by climate change </h3>
    <p> <em>Venice had begun being affected by climate change throughout my life.</em> There are always news stories about Venice flooding and such. Everything points to the fact that one day, climate change will cause venice to sink.</P>
    <h3> How Venice be affected by climate change in the future </h3>
    <p><br>Climate change is not the direct cause of the flooding of the city but it does play a role. People normally think of climate change as sea leavels rising but the way it is and will continue to affect Venice is a bit different. Climate change is making storms that cause high tides and severe flooding in Venice more frequent and likely. </p>
    <hr>
    <h3> What can be done to stop or slow down climate change </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Countrys should stop burning fossil fuels</li>
        <li> Countrys should swithc to a cleaner more sustainnable way of producing energy</li>
        <li> I do not know if this is practical but maybe a high sea wall around the city that would rise when a storm came</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> What are the people in the area already doing to limit the impact of climate change? </h2>
    <p> <strong>The people of Venice alone cannot do much to stop this destruciton as, to my knowledge, are not one of the main areas even causing climate change.</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Venice requests support form the government for help finding a way to prevent the destruction in the future</li>
        <li>Venice requests finiacial assitance from the government if needed. They need to do this because the damages can be severe</li>
        <li>The citizens of venice try to move important items such as food away from the water as well as putting up these sort of bridges to help have an area to walk when the water is too deep</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50401308">Mr Brugnaro said the damage was "huge" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods "must be finished soon".
    "The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us," he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides.
